## General info 
Firstly, I just want to mark, that it is my first independent application which I made within "MegaKurs". I tried to use all technologies that I learned durning 
this course. 


As music fan I decided to make something associated with it.
In this application you're able to roll "your daily song". Before roll you can make a choice between the
most popular music generes. You can also add your own song to database. That give you possibility to discover new awesome songs!
<br/><br/> Also you are able to create your own "favourite" list.
In future there will be few new things for registered users.
